## Installation

There is some more struggle in order to use the python bindings.
Because python users are using numpy library to perform their computation, i wanted this lib to be able to handle numpy array as input. To do so i used boost python library.

Clone [pid-workspace](https://github.com/lirmm/pid-workspace.git) if you don't have one yet.

Then
```bash
cd <pid-workspace>/pid
cmake ..
make deploy package=wrench-cone-lib
```

### About python version

You may need to install the adequate numpy python modules on your system, depending on the version of python you intend to use. On Debian like systems like ubuntu:

```
sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install python-pip python3-pip
sudo pip install numpy; sudo pip3 install numpy
```

### Installing boost.python

For now, PID does not provide proper handles for building boost python automatically. It only provides a prebuilt boost binary package for 64 bit linux versions.

If your system does not matches these specifications, here is the steps to build and install boost cleanly:

Download boost python version 1.64.0 [boost_1_64_0.tar.gz](http://www.boost.org/users/history/version_1_64_0.html)
then extract the files

```bash
cd <Donwload_folder>
tar xvzf boost_1_64_0.tar.gz
cd boost_1_64_0
```

Build and install the library in PID external packages

```bash
./bootstrap.sh --prefix=<PID-workspace>/external/<platform>/boost/1.64.0
./b2 -j4 install
```

Build the package one more time.

```bash
cd <pid-workspace>/packages/wrench-cone-lib/build
git checkout integration
make build
```


### Setting the PYTHONPATH

Add the path to your PYTHONPATH and you are done.

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:<pid-workspace>/install/python2.7
```

### Build example and docs
You can perform a `ccmake .` in the build directory of the git **integration** branch.
You can then mark **ON** the options for building the examples and doxygen files. Then `make build`
